# Warsjawa Docker Workshop

This is a repository which will be used for a essential docker training held at Warsjawa 2014 conference by [mieciu](https://github.com/mieciu) and [3h4x](https://github.com/3hx4).

We divided this repo in subdirectories, each of it contains practical examples of what and how can be done with docker.

Might be not really self-explanatory, because its just integrated part of our workshop :smile:
